                <p class="d1">The Seoul Olympic Swimming Pool is a public swimming facility located inside the Jamsil Sports Complex in Songpa-gu, Seoul. Originally built for the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, it continues to operate as a public sports facility that meets international competition standards. The complex is centered around an indoor swimming pool, with additional auxiliary pools or outdoor facilities operating seasonally. It is designed to accommodate both professional athletes and the general public.</p>
                <p class="d2">The Seoul Olympic Swimming Pool was designed with international competitions in mind, and its scale, depth, and lane layout follow standardized regulations. The main pool has a large number of lanes and sufficient width, allowing multiple activities such as training sessions and group practices to take place simultaneously.<br><br>Operations are highly structured. Depending on the time of day, lanes are clearly divided into athlete-only lanes, lesson lanes, and general lap swimming lanes. As a result, users are expected to choose specific time slots based on their purpose, and lane usage may be restricted according to on-site instructions.</p>
                <p class="d3">As a public sports facility, rules are strictly enforced. Wearing a swim cap is mandatory, and lifeguards closely monitor lane direction, resting behavior, and swimming methods. Because the pool is primarily indoors, it is not affected by weather conditions, allowing for consistent use throughout the year.<br><br>Changing rooms and auxiliary facilities are designed to handle large numbers of users efficiently, prioritizing function over comfort. Overall, the Seoul Olympic Swimming Pool functions less as a leisure-oriented space and more as a piece of public sports infrastructure dedicated to training, competition, and everyday swimming activities.</p>
