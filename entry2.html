                <p class="d1">Aqua Field Shiba Park is a public outdoor swimming pool located inside Shiba Park in Minato Ward, Tokyo. It is a municipal sports facility operated by the local ward government and is open only during the summer season. The main facility is a 50-meter outdoor pool, and standard regulations for public pools in Japan apply, including the mandatory use of swim caps. From certain areas of the pool, Tokyo Tower is visible, which gives the site a distinctive urban context.</p>
                <p class="d2">Because the pool is fully outdoors, its operation is strongly affected by weather conditions. Entry may be restricted or the facility may temporarily close during rain, strong winds, or unstable weather. There is no roof or shade over the main pool, so swimmers are directly exposed to sunlight, and surface glare can become strong depending on the time of day. <br><br>The 50-meter pool is typically divided into lanes according to swimming purpose. Lanes for continuous lap swimming and lanes for general use are separated, and the configuration may change based on crowd levels. As a publicly managed facility, staff closely monitor swimmer behavior, and users may be instructed if they stop for extended periods in lanes or do not follow designated swimming directions.</p>
                <p class="d3">As is common in many public pools in Japan, visible tattoos may be restricted, and swimmers may be asked to cover them according to on-site guidance. Changing rooms and lockers are designed for practicality rather than comfort, reflecting the pool’s role as a functional public sports facility.<br><br>Although it is located in central Tokyo, the pool maintains a relatively quiet atmosphere due to its setting within Shiba Park. There is no background music or commercial programming; instead, ambient sounds from the park and distant city noise form the primary sound environment. Overall, Aqua Field Shiba Park functions less as a leisure-oriented resort and more as a straightforward outdoor sports facility within the city.</p>
